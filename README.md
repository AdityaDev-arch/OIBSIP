## 🚀 Task 1: Command-Line BMI Calculator

### Project Description

A Python-based tool designed to calculate a user's **Body Mass Index (BMI)** and classify it into health categories such as Underweight, Normal Weight, Overweight, and Obese. This project focuses on clean code, accurate mathematical implementation, and robust error handling.

### ✨ Key Features

- **User Input Validation:** Ensures that weight and height inputs are positive numbers and handles non-numeric inputs gracefully using `try-except` blocks.
- **Realistic Range Checks:** Includes logic to warn users if a height seems unrealistic (e.g., entered in centimeters instead of meters).
- **Automated Categorization:** Classifies the BMI result based on standard WHO health ranges.
- **Professional CLI Output:** Uses visual dividers and formatted strings for a clean user experience.

### 🛠️ Technical Concepts Used

- **Python Basics:** Functions, Conditional Statements (`if-elif-else`).
- **Error Handling:** `ValueError` and `ZeroDivisionError` handling.
- **Input/Output:** `f-strings` for precise decimal formatting.
- **Environment:** Virtual environment (venv) for dependency isolation.
